# Final-Invader
A small game coded with Greenfoot in Java originally meant as my final project for my High School programming class. All sprites and sounds are completely original. Arrow keys to move, spacebar to shoot.

In case you couldn't tell by the fact that I haven't updated this since September 2018, updates for this project have more or less stopped. Thankfully, I actually have something planned for this project, I am in in the process of porting it to a more capable Java engine: HaxeFlixel! I don't know when this will be done if at all, so just stay tuned.
