(6/26/19) Minor: Stars appear above all other sprites. This is because sprites appear above other sprites that were added before them. Problem solely cosmedic.

(7/2/19)  Major: Player can only shoot once. This has something to to with projInWorld not being set to false for some reason. Problem prevents player from killing enemies.
	  Status: Solved, add(proj) wouldn't work after proj.destroy() was called, solved by having the proj teleport to the player when space is pressed, having proj move upward. (7/2/19)

(6/27/19) Major: Game freezes when an enemy spawns. This has something to do with accessing the player's y coordinate. Allocating the y coordinate to a seperate variable as well as comparing getMidPoint yeild the same result. Problem prevents enemies from killing player.
	  Status: Solved, tried to call the player from Enemy when it was initialized in PlayState. Returned errors so I initialized a new player in Enemies thinking it would refer to the same player initialized in PlayState. (7/2/19)

(7/3/19)  Major: Enemies sometimes don't die after being hit by proj. Not entirely sure why, can't figure out how to monitor variables to find out. Problem negitavely affects gameplay experience.
	  Status: Solved, game looked at proj's origin's y coordinate (origin being its lower-left corner), and looked at its x coordinate when I wanted it to look at its y coordinate. (7/4/19)
